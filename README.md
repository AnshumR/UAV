## UAV Flight Path Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project that focuses on automating the prediction of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) flight paths using machine learning models. It includes simulated flight data, model training, and 3D visualizations of both actual and predicted UAV trajectories.

Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict future UAV positions based on historical flight data. The project includes:

A dataset with simulated flight path data.
Predictive modeling to forecast UAV movement.
3D animations visualizing actual vs. predicted flight paths using Plotly.
Features
Predictive Modeling: Train machine learning models to predict the UAV's flight path.
3D Visualization: Visualize UAV movement in real-time with animated flight path plots.
Applications: Potential uses in logistics, agriculture, and military for autonomous UAV control and path prediction.
Installation
Clone the repository:
